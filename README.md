# Coffee-Shop-Simulation

To visualise the GUI class, you need to download WindowBuilder:
   On the taskbar, select Help -> Eclipse Marketplace -> type WindowBuilder -> Install WindowBuilder 1.9.4
   Then you can select GUI class, right click -> Open with -> WindowBuilder editor. You can select design instead of source to view GUI.
To make GUI work, you need to add a new library:
   For the library: Right click CoffeeShopProject -> Build Path -> Configure Biuld Path -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add Library -> JRE System Library -> Execution    Environment -> JavaSE 1.8 -> Finish -> Apply and close
To make GUI work, you need to add a plugin:
   Download : org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_64
   Link: https://jar-download.com/?search_box=org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x64&fbclid=IwAR0VYlPXxaZbYwREuRdSOoFX3hbKqTcIWzLrLMRQu6wbKx_SVS5tz6MqNFM
   Add it to your plugin in eclipse
   Right click CoffeeShopProject -> Build Path -> Configure Biuld Path -> Java Build Path -> Add Variable -> Configure Variables -> New -> Find the plugin you downloaded -> Finish -> Apply and close
