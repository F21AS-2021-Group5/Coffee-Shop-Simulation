# Coffee-Shop-Simulation

This application is a simulation of a coffee shop system. The user can visualise a menu, choose items and purchase his order via a GUI interface. The items from the menu are shown by categories and the user can visualise his order and receipt. Multiple purchase can be made by different user/customer and the final report is displayed at the end. The goal of this project was to develop a suitable software architecture, using appropriate data structure, and test throughout the deveopment of the application to deliver a successful Coffe Shop interface.
